  exclude-files:
    # For whatever reason, the exclude-dirs setting isn't honored when
    # golangci-lint is targeting one of these files *specifically* rather
    # than whole whole workspace / directory. This happens when opening up
    # one of these files in VS Code, which will have the linter complain
    # loudly. Hopefully this workaround can be removed in the future.
