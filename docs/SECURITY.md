# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release of Regal is supported in the sense that it has any chance of seeing patch releases.

We frequently do patch releases even for ordinary issues when found following a release, and security issues would
be no exception.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues may be reported either by email to [devrel@styra.com](mailto:devrel@styra.com), or to the admins in the
[Styra Community Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/styracommunity/signup). You should expect a response within 24
hours, but most likely much sooner.
