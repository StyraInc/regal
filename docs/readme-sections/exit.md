## Exit Codes

Exit codes are used to indicate the result of the `lint` command. The `--fail-level` provided for `regal lint` may be
used to change the exit code behavior, and allows a value of either `warning` or `error` (default).

If `--fail-level error` is supplied, exit code will be zero even if warnings are present:

- `0`: no errors were found
- `0`: one or more warnings were found
- `3`: one or more errors were found

This is the default behavior.

If `--fail-level warning` is supplied, warnings will result in a non-zero exit code:

- `0`: no errors or warnings were found
- `2`: one or more warnings were found
- `3`: one or more errors were found
