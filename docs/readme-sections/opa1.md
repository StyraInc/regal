## Regal and OPA 1.0+

Starting from version v0.30.0, Regal supports working with both
[OPA 1.0+]((https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/announcing-opa-1-0-a-new-standard-for-policy-as-code-a6d8427ee828))
policies and Rego from earlier versions of OPA. While everything should work without additional configuration,
we recommend checking out our documentation on using Regal with [OPA 1.0](https://docs.styra.com/regal/opa-one-dot-zero)
and later for the best possible experience managing projects of any given Rego version, or even a mix of them.
