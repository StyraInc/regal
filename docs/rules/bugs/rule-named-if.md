# rule-named-if

**Summary**: Rule named `if`

**Category**: Bugs

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

allow := true if {
    authorized
}
```

**Prefer**
```rego
package policy

import future.keywords.if

allow := true if {
    authorized
}
```

## Rationale

Forgetting to import the `if` keyword (using `import future.keywords.if`) is a common mistake. While this often results
in a parse error, there are some situations where the parser can't tell if the `if` is intended to be used as the
imported keyword, or a new rule named `if`. This is almost always a mistake, and if it isn't â€” consider using a better
name for your rule!
