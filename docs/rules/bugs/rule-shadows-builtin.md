# rule-shadows-builtin

**Summary**: Rule name shadows built-in

**Category**: Bugs

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

# `or` is an operator
or := 1 + 1

# `startswith` is a built-in function
startswith := indexof("rego", "r")
```

## Rationale

Using the name of built-in functions or operators as rule and variable names can lead to confusion and unexpected
behavior.

## Configuration Options

This linter rule provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
rules: 
  bugs:
    rule-shadows-builtin:
      # one of "error", "warning", "ignore"
      level: error
```
