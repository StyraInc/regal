# custom-has-key-construct

**Summary**: Custom function may be replaced by `in` and `object.keys`

**Category**: Idiomatic

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

import future.keywords.if

mfa if has_key(input.claims, "mfa")

has_key(map, key) if {
    _ = map[key]
}
```

**Prefer**
```rego
package policy

import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in

mfa if "mfa" in object.keys(input.claims)
```

## Rationale

Checking if a key exists in an object (regardless of the attribute's value) used to be done using custom functions. With
the introduction of the [object.keys](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#builtin-object-objectkeys)
(OPA [v0.47.0](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.47.0)) function, this is no longer necessary,
and using the built-in function together with `in` should be preferred.
