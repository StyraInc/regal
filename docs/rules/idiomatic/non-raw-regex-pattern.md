# non-raw-regex-pattern

**Summary**: Use raw strings for regex patterns

**Category**: Idiomatic

**Avoid**
```rego
all_digits if {
    regex.match("[\\d]+", "12345")
}
```

**Prefer**
```rego
all_digits if {
    regex.match(`[\d]+`, "12345")
}
```

## Rationale

[Raw strings](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/policy-language/#strings) are interpreted literally, allowing
you to avoid having to escape special characters like `\` in your regex patterns. Using raw strings for regex patterns
additionally makes them easier to identify as such.

## Limitations

This rule currently only scans regex string literals in the place of the `pattern` argument of the various
[regex built-in functions](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#regex). It will not **not**
try to "resolve" patterns assigned to variables. The following example would as such not render a warning:

```rego
package policy

import future.keywords.if

# Pattern assigned to variable
pattern := "[\\d]+"

# This won't trigger a violation
allow if regex.match(pattern, "12345")
```

## Configuration Options

This linter rule provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
rules:
  idiomatic:
    non-raw-regex-pattern:
      # one of "error", "warning", "ignore"
      level: error
```
