# implicit-future-keywords

**Summary**: Implicit future keywords

**Category**: Imports

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

import future.keywords

report contains violation if {
    not "developer" in input.user.roles
    
    violation := "Required role 'developer' missing"
}
```

**Prefer**
```rego
package policy

import future.keywords.contains
import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in

report contains violation if {
    not "developer" in input.user.roles
    
    violation := "Required role 'developer' missing"
}
```

## Rationale

Using the "catch all" import of `future.keywords` is convenient, but it can lead to unexpected behavior. If future
versions of OPA introduces new keywords, there's always a risk that these keywords will conflict with existing rule and
variable names in your policy.

## Configuration Options

This linter rule provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
rules: 
  imports:
    implicit-future-keywords:
      # one of "error", "warning", "ignore"
      level: error
```
