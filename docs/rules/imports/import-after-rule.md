# import-after-rule

**Summary**: Import declared after rule

**Category**: Imports

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

required_role := "developer"

import data.identity.users
```

**Prefer**
```rego
package policy

import data.identity.users

required_role := "developer"
```

## Rationale

Imports should be declared at the top of a policy, and before any rules. This makes it easy to quickly see the
dependencies imported in the policy simply by looking at the top of the file.

## Configuration Options

This linter rule provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
rules: 
  imports:
    import-after-rule:
      # one of "error", "warning", "ignore"
      level: error
```
